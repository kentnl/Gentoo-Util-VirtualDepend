Release history for Gentoo-Util-VirtualDepend

0.003019 2016-09-12T17:55:27Z e94b404
 - Remove special casing for Data::Buffer
 - Remove DBIx::SearchBuilder special case
 - Remove Digest::BubbleBabble special case

0.003018 2016-08-27T13:51:07Z 3fe5211
 - Remove Cache::Mmap special case.
 - When more than one module reports to index a given package, prefer the one that matches the module name.
 - Add Pod-Perldoc to virtuals list due to being impled in dev-lang/perl, even though the virtual does not itself
   exist.

 [Utils / vdep_check]
 - now uses Corelist directly for differencing instead of shelling out. This is much faster as
   Gentoo::Util::VirtualDepend loads Corelist anyway for its override checks.
 - now reports both changed and unchanged dists
 - now reports inconsistently versioned dists and inconsistently changed dists

 [Utils / vdep_report]
 - new utility, dumps an entire Perl's corelist grouped by Gentoo classification.
