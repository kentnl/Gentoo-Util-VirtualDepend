Gentoo::Util::VirtualDepend

This module serves as a low level glue layer for the handful of manual
mappings that are needed in Gentoo due to things not strictly tracking
upstream.

"CPANPLUS::Dist::Gentoo" has similar logic to this, but not as simple (
or for that matter, usable without "CPANPLUS" )

This module is not intended to be used entirely on its own, but as a
short-circuit before calling complicated "MetaCPAN" code.
